# CSEC202-Work

This repository is a portfolio for potential employers to access of all of the work I have completed for CSEC 202, Reverse Engineering Fundamentals. All of the assignments have been published AFTER their due date.

Portions of pubilshed code may be altered and/or deleted entirely to prevent from future cheating and/or misuse of the code. The problem statement/an altered assignment description will be provided for each assignment (each of which being published in its own directory)'s README file.

Since this class is primarily focused on analysis, code assestment and analysis will be published in the directory's README file. Answers to questions will not be provided in the README unless there is something curcial to the code's analysis in the question. 

Code written for exams will NOT be published in this repository.

I, the code author and contributor of this repository, am the sole owner of all code published here (unless otherwise stated and created). All code published here is for PORTFOLIO USE ONLY. I, the contributor, am not responsible for any misuse of published materials.
